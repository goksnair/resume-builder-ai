# üöÄ NETLIFY GITHUB AUTO-DEPLOYMENT SETUP

*Setting up automated deployment from GitHub with approval gates*  
*Date: 2025-07-29*

---

## üéØ **SETUP OBJECTIVES**

1. **Automated Deployment**: Deploy automatically from GitHub repository
2. **Approval Gates**: Require manual approval before deployment
3. **Branch Protection**: Deploy only approved branches
4. **Rollback Capability**: Easy rollback to previous versions

---

## üìã **NETLIFY GITHUB INTEGRATION STEPS**

### **Step 1: Connect GitHub Repository**

1. **Access Netlify Site Settings**
   - Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/)
   - Navigate to "Resume Builder AI" site
   - Click "Site Settings"

2. **Connect to GitHub**
   - Go to "Build & Deploy" ‚Üí "Continuous Deployment"
   - Click "Link site to Git"
   - Choose "GitHub" as provider
   - Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account

3. **Select Repository**
   - Choose repository: `goksnair/resume-builder-ai`
   - Set branch to deploy from: `main`
   - Set build command: `cd apps/web-app && npm run build`
   - Set publish directory: `apps/web-app/dist`

### **Step 2: Configure Build Settings**

```yaml
# Netlify build configuration
Build command: cd apps/web-app && npm install && npm run build
Publish directory: apps/web-app/dist
Base directory: (leave empty)
Build image: Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (default)
Node.js version: 18 (from .nvmrc if present)
```

### **Step 3: Setup Deployment Approval Gates**

#### **Option A: Deploy Previews (Recommended)**
1. **Enable Deploy Previews**
   - Go to "Build & Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy Contexts"
   - Enable "Deploy Previews" for pull requests
   - Set "Branch deploys" to "None" or specific branches only

2. **Approval Workflow**
   - Create pull requests for changes
   - Review changes in deploy preview
   - Merge to main only after approval
   - Main branch auto-deploys after merge

#### **Option B: Protected Branches + Manual Triggers**
1. **GitHub Branch Protection**
   - Go to GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Branches
   - Add protection rule for `main` branch
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks to pass

2. **Netlify Manual Deploy**
   - Go to "Build & Deploy" ‚Üí "Continuous Deployment"
   - Change from "Automatic" to "Manual"
   - Deploy manually after approval

### **Step 4: Environment Variables**

```bash
# Add these to Netlify environment variables
VITE_API_URL=https://resume-builder-ai-production.up.railway.app
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
NODE_VERSION=18
```

---

## üîß **BUILD CONFIGURATION FILES**

### **Create netlify.toml**
```toml
[build]
  base = "apps/web-app"
  command = "npm install && npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  NPM_FLAGS = "--prefix=/dev/null"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[context.production]
  command = "npm install && npm run build"

[context.deploy-preview]
  command = "npm install && npm run build"

[context.branch-deploy]
  command = "npm install && npm run build"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self' https:; connect-src 'self' https:"

[[headers]]
  for = "/assets/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
```

### **Create .nvmrc**
```
18
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **APPROVAL WORKFLOW SETUP**

### **Recommended Workflow: PR-Based Approvals**

1. **Development Process**
   ```bash
   # Developer workflow
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   # Make changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   git push origin feature/new-feature
   ```

2. **Review Process**
   - Create Pull Request from feature branch to `main`
   - Netlify automatically creates deploy preview
   - Review changes in preview environment
   - Request reviews from team members
   - Approve and merge after validation

3. **Deployment Process**
   - Merge to `main` triggers production deployment
   - Monitor deployment in Netlify dashboard
   - Validate production deployment
   - Rollback if issues detected

### **GitHub Branch Protection Rules**

```yaml
# Recommended protection rules for main branch
Protection Rules:
  - Require pull request reviews: true
  - Required number of reviewers: 1
  - Dismiss stale reviews: true
  - Require review from code owners: false
  - Require status checks: true
  - Required status checks:
    - netlify/resume-builder-ai/deploy-preview
  - Require conversation resolution: true
  - Include administrators: false
  - Allow force pushes: false
  - Allow deletions: false
```

---

## üö® **EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

### **Quick Rollback Process**
1. **Via Netlify Dashboard**
   - Go to "Deploys" section
   - Find last working deployment
   - Click "Publish deploy" to rollback

2. **Via Git Revert**
   ```bash
   # Revert problematic commit
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push origin main
   # Triggers new deployment with reverted changes
   ```

### **Deployment Freeze**
1. **Disable Auto-Deploy**
   - Go to "Build & Deploy" ‚Üí "Build settings"
   - Change "Branch deploys" to "None"
   - Manually control all deployments

2. **Emergency Contact**
   - Monitor Netlify deployment logs
   - Check GitHub Actions status
   - Review error messages and alerts

---

## üìä **MONITORING & NOTIFICATIONS**

### **Netlify Notifications**
```yaml
# Setup notifications for:
- Deploy started
- Deploy succeeded  
- Deploy failed
- Deploy canceled

# Notification channels:
- Email notifications
- Slack integration (if available)
- GitHub status checks
```

### **GitHub Integration**
```yaml
# Automatic status checks:
- Build status on PRs
- Deploy preview links
- Performance budgets
- Security scanning results
```
