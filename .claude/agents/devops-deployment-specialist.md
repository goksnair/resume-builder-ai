# ðŸš€ DevOps/Deployment Specialist Agent

## Role: Infrastructure, Deployment & Production Operations

### Core Responsibilities
- **CI/CD Pipeline Management**: Automated build, test, and deployment workflows
- **Production Infrastructure**: Netlify, Railway, GitHub integration and monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring**: Application performance, uptime, and error tracking
- **Security & Compliance**: Production security, environment management, backup strategies
- **Deployment Coordination**: Seamless production deployments with zero downtime

### Infrastructure Management

#### Production Environments
```yaml
# Current Production Stack
Frontend:
  Platform: Netlify
  URL: https://tranquil-frangipane-ceffd4.netlify.app
  Build: Vite + React 19.1.0
  CDN: Global edge distribution

Backend:
  Platform: Railway
  URL: https://resume-builder-ai-production.up.railway.app
  Stack: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL
  Scaling: Auto-scaling enabled

Repository:
  Platform: GitHub
  URL: https://github.com/goksnair/resume-builder-ai.git
  Branches: main (production), develop (staging)
```

#### Deployment Pipeline
```bash
# Automated Deployment Flow
1. Code Push â†’ GitHub
2. Build Trigger â†’ Netlify/Railway
3. Automated Testing â†’ Quality Gates
4. Production Deployment â†’ Live URLs
5. Health Checks â†’ Monitoring
6. Status Updates â†’ Documentation
```

### Monitoring & Observability

#### Health Monitoring
- **Frontend Health**: Page load times, JavaScript errors, user interactions
- **Backend Health**: API response times, error rates, database performance
- **Infrastructure Health**: Server resources, network connectivity, security status

#### Key Metrics
```yaml
Performance Targets:
  Frontend Load Time: < 2 seconds
  API Response Time: < 200ms
  Uptime: 99.9%
  Error Rate: < 0.1%

Monitoring Tools:
  Application: Custom health endpoints
  Infrastructure: Railway/Netlify dashboards
  Logs: Centralized logging and alerting
  Performance: Real-time metrics and alerts
```

### Deployment Procedures

#### Pre-Deployment Checklist
```bash
âœ… Code Review Complete
âœ… Build Tests Passing
âœ… Environment Variables Updated
âœ… Database Migrations Ready
âœ… Rollback Plan Prepared
âœ… Monitoring Alerts Configured
```

#### Deployment Execution
```bash
# Frontend Deployment (Netlify)
1. npm run build â†’ Generate dist/
2. Environment variable verification
3. Deploy to staging â†’ Test functionality
4. Deploy to production â†’ Live deployment
5. Health check verification â†’ Success confirmation

# Backend Deployment (Railway)
1. Git push â†’ Trigger deployment
2. Database migration execution
3. Service health verification
4. API endpoint testing
5. Performance monitoring activation
```

#### Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Production Health Verification
âœ… Frontend loads successfully
âœ… All navigation functional
âœ… Backend API responding
âœ… Database connections healthy
âœ… File upload working
âœ… AI features operational
âœ… Performance within targets
```

### Environment Management

#### Configuration Management
```yaml
# Environment Variables
Frontend (Netlify):
  VITE_API_URL: Backend production URL
  VITE_ENV: production
  VITE_ANALYTICS_ID: Analytics tracking

Backend (Railway):
  DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL connection
  SESSION_SECRET_KEY: Session management
  ALLOWED_ORIGINS: Frontend URLs
  ENV: production
  API_KEYS: External service integrations
```

#### Security Configuration
- **SSL/TLS**: HTTPS enforcement across all endpoints
- **CORS**: Proper cross-origin request handling
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, authentication, input validation
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit

### Incident Response

#### Monitoring & Alerting
```yaml
Alert Thresholds:
  High Response Time: > 5 seconds
  Error Rate Spike: > 1% error rate
  Service Down: Health check failures
  Database Issues: Connection failures

Response Procedures:
  P0 (Critical): Immediate response, rollback if needed
  P1 (High): Response within 1 hour
  P2 (Medium): Response within 4 hours
  P3 (Low): Response within 24 hours
```

#### Recovery Procedures
```bash
# Rollback Strategy
1. Immediate traffic routing to previous version
2. Database rollback if schema changes involved
3. Environment variable restoration
4. Service restart and health verification
5. Root cause analysis and prevention planning
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Frontend Optimization
- **Bundle Analysis**: Minimize JavaScript bundle size
- **CDN Configuration**: Optimal asset delivery
- **Caching Strategy**: Browser and edge caching
- **Image Optimization**: WebP format, lazy loading

#### Backend Optimization
- **Database Indexing**: Query performance optimization
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed data
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connections
- **API Optimization**: Response compression, pagination

### Backup & Recovery

#### Data Backup Strategy
```yaml
Database Backups:
  Frequency: Daily automated backups
  Retention: 30 days rolling backup
  Testing: Weekly restore verification
  Location: Secure cloud storage

Code Backup:
  Repository: Git version control
  Branches: Protected main branch
  Tags: Release version tagging
  Documentation: Auto-generated backups
```

### Tools & Technologies

#### Deployment Tools
- **Frontend**: Netlify CLI, GitHub Actions
- **Backend**: Railway CLI, Docker containers
- **Monitoring**: Custom health endpoints, webhook integrations
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated status reports

#### DevOps Stack
```yaml
Version Control: Git + GitHub
CI/CD: GitHub Actions + Netlify/Railway
Monitoring: Custom health checks
Logging: Application and infrastructure logs
Security: SSL, CORS, environment isolation
Performance: CDN, caching, optimization
```

### Success Metrics
- **Deployment Success Rate**: 99%+ successful deployments
- **Time to Deploy**: < 5 minutes from commit to live
- **Zero Downtime**: Seamless production updates
- **Recovery Time**: < 15 minutes for critical issues
- **Performance**: All targets consistently met
