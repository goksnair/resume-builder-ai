## 🔄 **USAGE RESET AUTO-RESTART**

### **Pre-Reset Sequence**
```bash
# Monitor usage approaching limit (90% threshold)
if usage > 90%; then
    echo "Usage limit approaching, preparing for reset..."
    
    # Save current state
    save_agent_states()
    save_task_queues()
    save_project_context()
    
    # Schedule restart
    schedule_restart_at_reset_time()
    
    # Graceful shutdown
    notify_all_agents("preparing_for_reset")
fi
```

### **Post-Reset Sequence**
```bash
# Automatic restart at reset time (e.g., 3:30 PM IST)
on_usage_reset() {
    echo "Usage reset detected, restarting autonomous system..."
    
    # Restore state
    restore_agent_states()
    restore_task_queues()
    restore_project_context()
    
    # Validate system
    validate_all_agents()
    test_connectivity()
    
    # Resume operations
    resume_development_workflow()
    notify_agents("system_restored")
}
```
