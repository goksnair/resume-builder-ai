# üß† CORE AGENT MEMORY - Universal Guidelines

## Core Role Function (All Agents Must Follow)

### 1. Planning-First Methodology
```yaml
CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Plan tasks in detail BEFORE execution
Process:
  1. ANALYZE: Understand current state and requirements thoroughly
  2. PLAN: Create detailed step-by-step implementation strategy
  3. REASON: Document detailed reasoning for each decision
  4. VALIDATE: Verify plan completeness before starting execution
  5. EXECUTE: Implement according to detailed plan
  6. VERIFY: Confirm results match planned outcomes

Forbidden Approach:
  - NO trial-and-error execution
  - NO jumping directly to coding without planning
  - NO assumptions without verification
  - NO partial solutions without full context
```

### 2. Context Preservation Requirements
```yaml
MANDATORY: Every agent must preserve context automatically
Actions Required:
  1. Save chat context and conversation history
  2. Update implementation guides and documentation
  3. Commit changes to GitHub repository
  4. Update production status documentation
  5. Notify user of automatic saves completed

Auto-Save Triggers:
  - After completing any significant task
  - Before starting new major work
  - When switching between different components
  - At end of each work session
  - When critical issues are resolved
```

### 3. Reasoning Documentation
```yaml
REQUIRED: Detailed reasoning for all decisions
Documentation Must Include:
  - WHY this approach was chosen
  - WHAT alternatives were considered
  - HOW this solution addresses the requirements
  - WHAT potential risks or limitations exist
  - WHEN this should be revisited or updated

Format:
  ## Decision: [Brief description]
  ### Reasoning:
  - Analysis of current state
  - Consideration of alternatives
  - Risk assessment
  - Implementation strategy
  - Success criteria
```

### 4. Quality Standards
```yaml
MINIMUM QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
  - All code must be production-ready
  - All features must be tested thoroughly
  - All implementations must follow existing patterns
  - All changes must maintain backward compatibility
  - All documentation must be comprehensive and up-to-date

Before Marking Tasks Complete:
  1. Verify functionality works end-to-end
  2. Test edge cases and error conditions
  3. Ensure performance meets requirements
  4. Validate security considerations
  5. Update relevant documentation
```

### 5. Communication Protocol
```yaml
REQUIRED: Keep user informed of all activities
Status Updates Must Include:
  - What work was completed
  - What challenges were encountered
  - What decisions were made and why
  - What next steps are planned
  - When auto-save operations completed

Auto-Save Notifications:
  "‚úÖ Auto-save completed: [description of what was saved]"
  "üìù Updated GitHub repository with latest changes"
  "üîÑ Context preservation completed successfully"
```

### 6. Collaboration Standards
```yaml
INTER-AGENT COORDINATION:
  - Share relevant findings with other agents
  - Document dependencies and integration points
  - Coordinate timing of related changes
  - Validate changes don't break other components
  - Communicate blockers immediately

INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - Test integrations with other agent work
  - Maintain API compatibility
  - Follow established coding patterns
  - Update shared documentation
  - Verify end-to-end functionality
```
