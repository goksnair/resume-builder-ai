# 🛡️ GITHUB BRANCH PROTECTION CONFIGURATION
*For Resume Builder AI - Netlify Auto-Deployment*

## 🎯 **BRANCH PROTECTION OBJECTIVES**

1. **Prevent Direct Pushes**: Require pull requests for all changes to main
2. **Code Review Gates**: Mandatory review before merge  
3. **Status Check Integration**: Netlify deploy previews must pass
4. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure only tested code reaches production

---

## ⚙️ **GITHUB BRANCH PROTECTION SETUP**

### **Step 1: Access Repository Settings**
1. Go to [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/goksnair/resume-builder-ai)
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Navigate to **Branches** in left sidebar
4. Click **Add rule** or edit existing rule for `main` branch

### **Step 2: Configure Protection Rules**

#### **Basic Protection Settings**
```yaml
Branch name pattern: main
```

#### **Protect matching branches**
- ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
  - ✅ Require approvals: `1`
  - ✅ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
  - ✅ Require review from code owners: `false` (optional)

- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - **Required status checks:**
    - `netlify/resume-builder-ai/deploy-preview` (will appear after first Netlify connection)

- ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**

- ✅ **Require signed commits**: `false` (optional)

- ✅ **Require linear history**: `false` (optional)

#### **Restrict pushes that create files**
- ❌ Do not enable (not needed for this workflow)

#### **Rules applied to everyone including administrators**
- ❌ **Include administrators**: `false` (allows emergency fixes)

#### **Allow force pushes**
- ❌ **Allow force pushes**: `false`

#### **Allow deletions** 
- ❌ **Allow deletions**: `false`

## 🔄 **RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW**

### **Development Process**
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# 2. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature

# 3. Create Pull Request
# - GitHub will automatically create deploy preview via Netlify
# - Review changes in preview environment
# - Request review from team member
# - Merge after approval
```

### **Pull Request Template**
Create `.github/pull_request_template.md`:
```markdown
## 📋 **Pull Request Checklist**

## 🚀 **NETLIFY INTEGRATION SETTINGS**

### **Deploy Context Configuration**
Once Netlify is connected to GitHub:

1. **Production Deploys** (main branch)
   - Automatically deploy when PR is merged to main
   - Use production environment variables

2. **Deploy Previews** (Pull Requests)
   - Automatically build preview for each PR
   - Use development/staging environment variables
   - Provides preview URL for testing

3. **Branch Deploys** (Feature branches)
   - Disable to avoid unnecessary builds
   - Only use deploy previews for PRs

### **Status Check Integration**
Netlify will automatically report build status to GitHub:
- ✅ `netlify/resume-builder-ai/deploy-preview` - Deploy preview successful
- ❌ `netlify/resume-builder-ai/deploy-preview` - Deploy preview failed

---

## 🔐 **SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS**

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Production (Netlify)
VITE_API_URL=https://resume-builder-ai-production.up.railway.app
NODE_ENV=production

# Preview/Development
VITE_API_URL=https://resume-builder-ai-staging.up.railway.app
NODE_ENV=development
```

### **Sensitive Data Protection**
- Never commit API keys or secrets
- Use Netlify environment variables for sensitive config
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Monitor for exposed secrets in commits

---

## 🧪 **TESTING THE WORKFLOW**

### **Test 1: Create Feature Branch**
```bash
git checkout -b test/branch-protection
echo "# Test change" >> TEST_CHANGE.md
git add TEST_CHANGE.md
git commit -m "test: verify branch protection workflow"
git push origin test/branch-protection
```

### **Test 2: Create Pull Request**
1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Create PR from `test/branch-protection` to `main`
3. Verify deploy preview is created
4. Test preview environment
5. Request review (if required)
6. Merge after approval

### **Test 3: Verify Protection**
```bash
# This should fail with branch protection
git checkout main
echo "# Direct change" >> DIRECT_CHANGE.md
git add DIRECT_CHANGE.md
git commit -m "test: direct push should fail"
git push origin main
# Expected: Push should be rejected
```

---

## 🚨 **EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

### **Hotfix Process**
```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix

# 2. Make minimal necessary changes
# ... fix critical issue ...

# 3. Push and create urgent PR
git push origin hotfix/critical-fix
# Create PR with "HOTFIX" label
# Fast-track review and approval
```

### **Bypass Protection (Emergency Only)**
1. Temporarily disable branch protection if needed
2. Make direct commit to main
3. Immediately re-enable protection
4. Create follow-up PR to document emergency change

---
