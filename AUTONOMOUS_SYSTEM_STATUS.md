## 💡 **HOW IT WORKS**

When Claude shows: **"Claude usage limit reached. Your limit will reset at 2:30pm (Asia/Calcutta)"**

The system automatically:
1. 🔍 **Detects** the message in conversation
2. 📅 **Parses** the exact reset time and timezone
3. 💾 **Backs up** all contexts, states, and progress
4. ⏰ **Schedules** restart at precise reset time
5. 🔄 **Restarts** seamlessly when time arrives
6. 🚀 **Resumes** all development activities
7. 📊 **Reports** status and continues autonomous operation

**No manual intervention required at any step!**
