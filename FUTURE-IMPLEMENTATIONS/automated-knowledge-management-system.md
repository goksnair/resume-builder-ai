### **Key Technical Components**
1. **DailyKnowledgeMiner Class** - Main orchestrator
2. **KnowledgeSources Class** - Content discovery from multiple sources
3. **ContentProcessor Class** - Quality assessment and insight extraction
4. **KnowledgeBase Class** - Vector database and graph storage
5. **AIModelTrainer Class** - Automated model fine-tuning
6. **MiningMetricsCollector Class** - Performance monitoring

### **Target Data Sources**
- Harvard Business Review (Career Planning)
- LinkedIn Talent Blog & API
- Glassdoor Blog & Insights
- Indeed Career Guide
- Academic papers (SSRN, Google Scholar, ResearchGate)
- Industry salary reports and trend analysis

### **Automation Infrastructure**
- Daily cron jobs at 2 AM
- Docker-based scheduling with Ofelia
- Comprehensive monitoring dashboard
- Performance metrics and quality assessment

## 🔮 **Future Implementation Strategy**

### **When to Implement:**
- After multi-persona system is stable and proven
- When user base reaches 10,000+ active users
- When manual content curation becomes bottleneck
- When competitive pressure requires automated knowledge edge

### **Simplified Implementation Path:**
1. **Phase 1**: RSS feed aggregation + weekly human curation
2. **Phase 2**: Basic web scraping for top 5 career sites
3. **Phase 3**: API integrations (LinkedIn, Glassdoor)
4. **Phase 4**: Full automated pipeline with AI training

### **Success Metrics to Track First:**
- User engagement with current AI responses
- Completion rates through conversation flow
- User satisfaction scores
- Resume effectiveness metrics

### **Resource Requirements:**
- **Development**: 1 senior developer for 6-8 weeks
- **Infrastructure**: Vector database, web scraping services
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing monitoring and quality assurance
- **API Costs**: LinkedIn, academic database access

## 📊 **ROI Analysis**
- **High Development Cost**: Complex system requiring significant engineering
- **Uncertain User Impact**: Users may not notice improved AI responses
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Requires ongoing attention and updates
- **Recommendation**: Implement only after core features prove successful

## 🔄 **Alternative: Manual Curation**
Consider implementing a **Weekly Curator Model** instead:
- AI scans major career sites for top articles
- Human curator reviews and selects 5-10 key insights  
- AI integrates insights into persona responses
- System updates conversation templates weekly

**Benefits**: 80% of value with 20% of complexity
