# ✅ Railway Frontend Deployment Ready

## Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

The frontend is now fully configured for Railway deployment with all necessary files in place.

### ✅ Configuration Complete

1. **railway.json** - Railway deployment configuration
2. **Procfile** - Process definition for Railway
3. **package.json** - Added `serve` dependency for static hosting
4. **Build tested** - Production build successful (190KB + 264KB chunks)
5. **Serve tested** - Static file serving working on port 3001

### 🚀 Next Steps for Railway Deployment

#### Option 1: Via Railway Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Create new project or add service to existing project
3. Connect GitHub repository
4. Set root directory: `apps/web-app`
5. Railway will auto-detect configuration from `railway.json`

#### Option 2: Via Railway CLI
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and link
railway login
railway link

# Deploy from web-app directory
cd "apps/web-app"
railway up
```

### 🔧 Environment Variables to Set in Railway

```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app
```

**Detected automatically from files:**
- **Build Command**: `npm ci && npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `npx serve dist -s -l $PORT`
- **Root Directory**: `apps/web-app`
- **Builder**: NIXPACKS (Node.js)

### 🔗 Expected URLs After Deployment

- **Frontend**: `https://resume-builder-frontend-[hash].railway.app`
- **Backend**: `https://resume-builder-backend-[hash].railway.app`

### ⚡ Production Features Ready

- ✅ Static file serving with `serve`
- ✅ SPA routing support (`-s` flag)
- ✅ Automatic port binding (`$PORT`)
- ✅ Production build optimization
- ✅ Auto-restart on failure
- ✅ Health monitoring ready

### 🛡️ CORS Configuration

After deployment, update backend `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with:
```python
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ["https://your-frontend.railway.app"]
```
